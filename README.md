## 3. Applied Scenario

### (i) LinkedIn Scenario
In professional networking platforms like LinkedIn, users want to:

- Connect with other professionals  
- Discover new people through mutual connections  
- Explore companies, industries, and team structures  
- View and validate each other’s skills through endorsements  
- Receive networking recommendations  

**Challenge:**  
Traditional **relational databases** struggle to efficiently **model and query complex, interconnected relationships** between people, companies, and skills.

---

**Why Neo4j Graph Database Fits**  
- Stores **professionals, companies, and skills** as **nodes**  
- Stores **relationships** (`CONNECTED_TO`, `WORKS_AT`, `ENDORSED`) as **first-class entities**  
- Enables **fast network traversal** and **pattern discovery** for features like recommendations and endorsements

### (ii) How the Graph Database Models and Solves This Problem

| Step | **Task**                       | **Example**                                                        | **Notes**                                                                 |
|------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Create Professional Profiles   | Alice Johnson – *Software Engineer*, San Francisco, 5 years         | Nodes store metadata (title, location, experience). Created via Cypher `CREATE`. |
| 2    | Add Company Nodes               | Alice → TechCorp Inc (*Senior Software Engineer*, Engineering)      | Enables exploring company structure and industry details.                  |
| 3    | Add Skill Nodes & Links         | Python, Java, Machine Learning, UI Design, Docker                   | Skills linked to professionals; supports endorsements.                     |
| 4    | Connect Professionals           | Alice ↔ Bob Smith (*Strong*, 15 mutual connections)                 | Relationships store strength, mutual connection count, and connection date.|
| 5    | Run Queries for Insights        | - Networking recommendations<br>- Geographic clustering<br>- Employment landscape<br>- Connection analysis | Graph traversal queries extract targeted insights.                         |
| 6    | Update & Maintain the Network   | - Update profiles & companies<br>- Strengthen ties<br>- Remove outdated links | Reflects real-time changes in careers, companies, and relationships.       |
